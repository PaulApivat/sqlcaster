## Developing locally

This repo uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/), cause, why not? Seems fun.

Install deps

```
bun install
```

This repo is a pure client side web app so you can either just open `index.html` in your browser or if you prefer serve this folder locally using something like `python3 -m http.server`.
